## Medical Appontments No Shows
In this Udacity project, we'll be analyzing a dataset, associated with medical appointment records. The goal is to identify factors important in predicting if a patient is likely to show up for their scheduled appointment.

## Dataset
The data consists of information regarding 110,527 medical appointments in Brazil from May and June 2016, including a list of patients, their demographic information, whether they attended their appointment, and more. The dataset has been suggested by Udacity and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments.

## Key takeaways
(1) Younger patients generally tend to show up for their appointments more frequently. In particular, there seems to be a higher probability for children under 5 and patients in their 50's to show up.

(2) An approximately equal number of people who both received and didn't receive SMS didn't show up for their appointments. Thus, receiving sms doesn't seem to have a positive impact on patients' showing up.

(3) The day of the week doesn't seem to influence patients' showing up much. The majority of appointments both did and didn't take place on weekdays, not weekends, with the majority being set on Wednesdays and Tuesdays.
